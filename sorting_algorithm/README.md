# Sorting Algorithm

Sorting algorithm is part of the Data Structure & Algorithms fundamentals that I think is very interesting to learn.

Sorting is very important to understood before we learn Searching algorithm because we need our stuff to be sorted first before we can performed effective searching.

I admit I skip these fundamentals on my college because I feel it is so boring especially when they just teach me the theory and pseudo-code. They never told me why this is very important.

Now I want to strengthen my skill by re-learn fundamentals again starting with implementing sorting algorithm using Go Language.

If you are a student that wanna learn fundamentals thing of programming, feel free to come along with me.

Okay, that's the intro let's jump right into the code.

This repository will contain:

## 1. Bubble Sort

Bubble sort like it's name, we will doing iterations to the list / array we wanna sort, keep moving the largest thing (like number) we found to the right until we got the largest number and already move it to the right / end of the array (then pop it).

In every iteration of bubble sort, we will get the largest number of available in that iteration and move it to the end of array the we are sorting.

## 2. Insertion Sort

In short, we iterate through each elements of an array, and we insert it to the right position.

On implementation, I like to implements it using backward iteration where we keep comparing two elements of array and move the smaller one to the left position.
